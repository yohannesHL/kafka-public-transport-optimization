# Public Transport Optimization with Apache Kafka
A streaming event pipeline using Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data sourced from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/) we've constructed an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

## Description

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard displaying system status for its commuters. We have decided to use Kafka and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.

Our architecture will look like so:

![Project Architecture](images/diagram.png)

## Prerequisites

The following are required:

* Docker
* Python 3.7
* Access to a computer with a minimum of 16gb+ RAM and a 4-core CPU to execute the simulation


## Running and Testing

To run the simulation, you must first start up the Kafka ecosystem on their machine utilizing Docker Compose.

```%> docker-compose up```

Docker compose will take a 3-5 minutes to start, depending on your hardware. Please be patient and wait for the docker-compose logs to slow down or stop before beginning the simulation.

Once docker-compose is ready, the following services will be available:

| Service | Host URL | Docker URL | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Transit Status | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | n/a | ||
| Landoop Kafka Connect UI | [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) | http://connect-ui:8084 |
| Landoop Kafka Topics UI | [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) | http://topics-ui:8085 |
| Landoop Schema Registry UI | [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) | http://schema-registry-ui:8086 |
| Kafka | PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9094 | PLAINTEXT://kafka0:9092,PLAINTEXT://kafka1:9093,PLAINTEXT://kafka2:9094 |
| REST Proxy | [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/) | http://rest-proxy:8082/ |
| Schema Registry | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/ ) | http://schema-registry:8081/ |
| Kafka Connect | [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) | http://kafka-connect:8083 |
| KSQL | [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) | http://ksql:8088 |
| PostgreSQL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cta` | `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/cta` | `cta_admin` | `chicago` |

Note that to access these services from your own machine, you will always use the `Host URL` column.

When configuring services that run within Docker Compose, like **Kafka Connect you must use the Docker URL**. When you configure the JDBC Source Kafka Connector, for example, you will want to use the value from the `Docker URL` column.

### Running the Simulation

There are two pieces to the simulation, the `producer` and `consumer`. As you develop each piece of the code, it is recommended that you only run one piece of the project at a time.

However, when you are ready to verify the end-to-end system prior to submission, it is critical that you open a terminal window for each piece and run them at the same time. **If you do not run both the producer and consumer at the same time you will not be able to successfully complete the project**.

#### To run the `producer`:

1. `cd producers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python simulation.py`

Once the simulation is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.

#### To run the Faust Stream Processing Application:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `faust -A faust_stream worker -l info`


#### To run the KSQL Creation Script:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python ksql.py`

#### To run the `consumer`:

** NOTE **: Do not run the consumer until you have reached Step 6!
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python server.py`

Once the server is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.
